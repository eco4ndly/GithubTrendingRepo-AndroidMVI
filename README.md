#### A sample project to showcase apparently the best way to implement MVI architecture pattern in Android using ViewModel, Livedata and Kotlin Coroutine, without using RxJava.

###### ```MVIVM(MVI & MVVM) + Clean Architecture + Best Practices```

Currently MVI is love for all the Android guys out there and everyone is trying to adopt this new yet powerful pattern.
This repo could be a great help to those.

I would like to welcome folks who thinks can improve the codebase and introduce more tight-elegant way to implement MVI.
